"Encoding objects of type Markup is unsupported" error when ``flash_success``
and ``flash_error`` helpers called with enabled ``html`` flag is fixed by
changing session serialization strategy. Existing sessions stored inside Redis
cannot be deserialized with this new strategy and must be removed using the
command ``redis-cli keys "session:*" | xargs redis-cli del``. Non-redis session
backends are not affected by this change.
